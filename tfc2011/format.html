	  <h1>Format</h1>
      <p><strong>The format is  Ryder Cup style. </strong> </p>
      <p>We are playing this  format in the form of (2) 9 hole super ball sessions.  This means that all opponents are separated  into two BIG teams with each BIG team having a captain.  These BIG teams are then set up into two  person pairings.  These pairings then  compete, using match play format, to win points for their BIG team.  each pairing can either defeat their  opponents and gain their BIG team ONE point or they can tie, or HALVE, their  opponent thus giving both BIG teams a HALF point each. To win, one BIG team  needs to attain a minimum of FIVE points. In the case of a tie, the winner will be decided by the  captains picking a paring, from the last session, they want to use and a third  party picking one of the last sessions holes.   The pairing with the lowest score wins a HALF point.  Thus that BIG team will win.</p> 
      <p><strong>The Captain is  the person in charge of the BIG team.   His or her duties are as follows:</strong><br />
        Pick the players  for his/her team from the hat. (first pick will be determined by the toss of a  coin)<br />
      Set the line-ups  for his/her Ryder cup team for each session.</p>
      <p>Submit team name<br />
        Is the final  decision on any disputes concerning his/her team.</p>
<p>Sessions are  defined as a single nine holes of golf played by all pairings from both teams  with scores being tallied and recorded.   There will be three nine hole sessions played.</p>
      <p> - The line up for the  first session will be turned in first by the captain who received the first  draw from the hat.</p>
      <p> - The line up for the  second session will be turned in first by the captain who got the second draw  from the hat.</p>
      <p> - The line up for the  third session will be turned in by both captains together.</p>
      <p><strong>This is a Super  Ball scramble. </strong> A Super ball scramble  means that both people on the same team hit a shot, and then they decide which  of the two shots offers the best next shot.   After the decision is made, a marker of some sort (tee usually) is stuck  in the ground marking the lie and each ball is placed, in turn, within a club  length of the marker on either side.   Then both players proceed to hit again.   The process is repeated till the team has a ball in the bottom of the  cup.  NOTE: When the ball is on the  green, not the fringe, instead of a club length from the mark the ball can only  be placed a putter head distance on either side of the mark.</p>
      <p><strong>This is  MATCHPLAY.</strong>  This means that score is kept  by holes not strokes.  If one team scores  lower on the hole than the other then that team wins the hole.  This is represented by stating the winning  team is &quot;One UP', denoting the winning team is one hole up on their  opponent.  This marking method is  continued as holes are won (Two Up, Three Up, etc.). Following this same  process, the team that lost the hole would be represented by stating they are  &quot;One Down&quot;.  If both teams tie  a hole then that is stated as &quot;The Hole is Halved&quot;.  The match is considered complete when one  team is up more holes than are left to physically play.</p>
      <h2>For Example:</h2>
        <p>Team A and team B  are playing a nine hole match.<br />
        Team A scores a  lower score on hole one than team B.<br />
        This is recorded  as team A is &quot;One UP&quot; and team B is &quot;One Down&quot;.<br />
        On the second  Hole, team A scores lower than team B again.<br />
        Now, this is  recorded as team A is &quot;Two Up&quot; and team B is &quot;Two Down&quot;. <br />
        Holes three  through seven both teams make equal scores on every hole so they have  &quot;Halved&quot; these holes, HOWEVER team A is still up by Two Holes (they  won holes one and two). This is represented at team A is &quot;Two up with Two  Holes to play&quot;.<br />
        At this point, the  match is considered to be dormie.  Dormie  means that team B can not beat Team A in the match.  Team B can only tie the match or &quot;Halve  the Match&quot;.  To halve the match,  team B would need to score lower than team A on each of the remaining two  holes.<br />
        On hole eight,  team A scores lower than team B. This means that team A won the hole and is now  &quot;Three Holes Up&quot;.  Since team A  is up three holes and there is only one hole left to play, team A has won the  match.<br />
        The win is  represented as &quot;Team A won the match Three Up with One to Play&quot; or  &quot;Team A won Three and One&quot;.<br />
        <br />
      When the match is complete, meaning one team has won more  holes than the other, then both teams shall proceed to the clubhouse and report  their scores.  This may occur before a  full nine holes is played.  That is OK  and will help to speed play and prepare for the next session.</p>
